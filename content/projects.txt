h1. pre-scientific work in physics <span style="float:right; font-size: 0.8em">LaTeX</span>

<a href="/img/fba-title.png"><img src="/img/fba-title.png" style="float:left; width: 100px" /></a> Until late February I was occupied in writing and finishing a work called "Fachbereichsarbeit" for my grammar school graduation. My thesis has to do with current developments and theses in the debate of the accelerating expansion of the universe and theories dealing with these topics. It gives also an overview on the history of all the observations and discussions that led us to the state of play.

Due to my current long-term and time-consuming task, the Matura (Austrian grammar school graduation), it's impossible for me to engage in other projects by this time.

h1. "Particle Zoo":/particle-zoo/ <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">SVG</span>

<a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/sebix/particle-zoo/particle-zoo.png"><img src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/sebix/particle-zoo/particle-zoo.png" style="float:left; width: 100px" /></a>This is my try to visualize the particles of the physical standard-model, showing not only the names and groups, but also some data like mass and spin. I created it as part of my pre-scientific work mentioned above.

h1. "acrylamid":https://github.com/sebix/acrylamid <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">Python</span>

acrylamid is a compiler for static blogs and homepages and very easy to set up, use and extend. It's a project of "posativ":http://posativ.org/ but I'm now deeply involved in the developement in conjunction with him.

h1. "Litotex":https://github.com/Litotex/Litotex-0.8 <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">PHP</span>

Litotex is a team work of the Litotex community of which I am part of. It's a PHP framework that has to be developped so far, so that the code is readable and the performance acceptable. The concepts of DRY and modulization are the aim of that project.
And of course: It's meant to make fun developping (on) it.

h1. "Unity-Opera":https://github.com/sebix/Unity-Opera <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">Python</span>

Unity-Opera is a small Python-Script that adds Unity integration to the Opera Webbrowser.
Unity is the new Desktop environment of the very popular Linux distribution Ubuntu.

Since I'm using Gnome2/3 instead of Unity I stopped working on it, but nevertheless the script behaves well with current versions of Unity.

h1. some gists

Small and unremarkable programs that deserve more usage!

h2. "Jamendo-Downloader":https://gist.github.com/1181355 <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">Bash</span>

This small Shell-Script can help you in enlarging your music repertoire! Just pass a tag (e.g. your favorite genre), the album or another list of music tracks or albums to the script and let them download in OGG or MP3.  It uses the "official API":http://developer.jamendo.com/en/wiki/Musiclist2Api of "Jamendo":http://www.jamendo.com/.

h2. "Batch-test your programs":https://gist.github.com/1086477 <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">Bash</span>

This script executes one given program with a bunch of input files and compares the output with the solution-files (if given). Very usefull when training for the "Olympiad in Informatics":http://ioinformatics.org/index.shtml, which provides huge testdata for every problem.
