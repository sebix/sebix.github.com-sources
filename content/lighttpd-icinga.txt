As I haven't found any working example configuration for running icinga on a sub domain with lighttpd, I will here present my working solution.
First of all, we need to install the software itself:

<pre>
  $ apt-get install icinga icinga-doc
</pre>

We create the file @/etc/lighttpd/conf-available/50-icinga.conf@ to have a configuration which is easy en- and disable:
<pre><code>
$HTTP["host"] =~ "icinga.example.org" {
	auth.backend = "htdigest"
	auth.backend.htdigest.userfile = "/etc/lighttpd/icinga.htdigest"
	auth.require = ( "/" => (
		"method"  => "digest",
		"realm"   => "icinga",
		"require" => "valid-user" 
		)
	)

	server.document-root = "/usr/share/icinga/htdocs"
	alias.url += (
		"/cgi-bin/icinga" => "/usr/lib/cgi-bin/icinga",
		"/icinga/stylesheets" => "/etc/icinga/stylesheets/",
		"/icinga" => "/usr/share/icinga/htdocs",
		"/stylesheets" => "/etc/icinga/stylesheets/",
	)

	$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/cgi-bin/" {
		dir-listing.activate = "disable" 
		cgi.assign = (
			".pl"  => "/usr/bin/perl",
			".cgi" => "" 
		)
	}
}
</pre></code>

Now we can activate the newly created config and two requirements for Lighty's config using:
<pre>
  $ lighty-enable-mod auth cgi icinga
</pre>

The *authentication is required by icinga* and it is highly encouraged not to use a common password and a common sub domain. If the web interface does not detect any user name, it will load the website, but the access to the data is restricted to valid users.

Now we need to create the digest file, containing the user names and password-hashes. We can therefor use the program @htdigest@, provided by @apache2-utils@, which should have been installed as a dependency of icinga.
<pre>
  $ htdigest -c "/etc/lighttpd/icinga.htdigest" icinga icingaadmin
</pre>

For Icinga on Lighttpd using a sub directory, take a look at "Cyconet Blog: Running Icinga With Lighttpd on Debian Wheezy":http://blog.waja.info/2013/11/24/running-icinga-with-lighttpd-on-a-raspberry/
